My Portfolio Website

I created this website from scratch. Not all the functions have been created as of now. For now, only the HOME, PROJECTS, CONTACT options from navigation bar have functions. If one clicks on projects then it will open a new page with all my projects listed. Unfornutely, I couldn't keep the same navigation bar on projects page but is a feature will be updated soo. Therefore, the back button needs to be used to go back to the main page. Same think for the contact as well. It will open a new page with all my contacts info. Also provides an opportunity to send me an email, however, I haven't linked my google account yet. It has some javascript functions like if you enter an email without @ symbol it will show you a alert. Moreover, if one tries to submit empty boxes then the webpage will alert the user.


The website currently is responsive for only desktop. The responsiveness for mobile phones and tablets will be brought soon. I am planning to build the lacking functionalities like same navigation bar in all pages and more javascript functionality and linking up my email and so on very soon.
