                <p> I have created a simple contacts application for desktop using Python's kivy framework.
                    The application has four grids and different layout inside the particular grids. The first gridsquare is used
                    to add contacts to the contact book. The second gridsquare is used to delete contact. The user provides the full
                    name of the saved contact. The software searches through all the saved contacts and removes the matched name.
                    It provides a confirmation message once the task has been completed. The next gridsquare is used to search through
                    all the saved contacts and displays the information in the display panel at the bottom of the grid. Finally, the 
                    last grid shows all the saved contacts in the contact book. After every task it provides with a confirmation message.

                    I created this game using Java Swing.
                    A two player game where one player selects a chocolate (in this case a gridsquare). A player can select a gridsquare
                    either from the left most column or top row (in some exaplmes  from the bottom row instead of top row).
                    Once a gridsquare is selected and is legal, means the user selected from top row or from left most column,
                    the right side and bottom grids will vanish. It continues this way until only the green colored gridsquare left.
                    Whoever, selects that square loses the game. At the end of the game a message is shown who lost and who won.
                    A single player can also play the game against the computer.

                    Ricochet Robots is a famous board game. I worked on this project with 4 other students in a course. I
                    contributed by making use case descriptions, drawing UML sequence diagrams, creating UML class and domain models
                    and coding specific classes of the entire game. I really enjoyed the project because I learned a lot and have applied my 
                    Object-oriented programming knowledge extensively. We created a board and some robots and some tokens. A token is displayed, 
                    then a player calls out a number to reach that destination and if no other user can challenge that number, then the first
                    bidder shows their path and if the is correct then the user collects the token. At the end the player with the most tokens wins the game.

                <p class= "para">This game has been created for colour deficiency people as well. We have used three different colour palletes to address
                    colour deficiency. The user can choose the preferable colour pallte to address specific colour deficiency from the settings options.
